# `shiori`

`shiori` is a disk imaging application similar to `ddrescue`, designed to
attempt to rescue dying disks. While not at all usable except as a toy right
now, I have some plans for disk imaging such that I'd rather write/maintain my
own tool.

## Why The Name?

IIRC, `shoiri` means "Bookmark" or similar in Japanese. That seems apt for
imaging/archiving disks. In reality, I named it after [Shiori Novella](https://hololive.hololivepro.com/en/talents/shiori-novella/),
Hololive's resident archivist.

The [`kanata`](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) Rust firmware has a [nod](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata#what-does-the-name-mean) to
[Power Point Tenshi](https://hololive.hololivepro.com/en/talents/amane-kanata). I
figure I'd follow suit.
